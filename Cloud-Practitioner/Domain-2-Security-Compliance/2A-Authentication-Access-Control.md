## AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  * ### Overview
    * IAM is an AWS web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources on your account.
    * IAM controls who is **authenticated** (signed in) and who is **authorized** (has permissions) to use resources.
  * ### Users
    * **Users** are individual accounts you log in with.
    * Users have **NO** permissions to access anything **by default**.
  * ### Groups
    * Groups are used for organizing users and assigning **policies** to them.
  * ### Policies
    * Policies are used for **defining** permissions (re: who is authorized to access what).
  * ### Roles
    * Roles are used for **delegating** permissions and are assumed by **services**.
    * AWS services can be assigned **roles** the same way roles can be assigned to users.
